## Getting Started

To help you get started quickly and gain a deep understanding of the framework, we provide the following documentation:

1. The framework has adapted some public datasets. Check [Quick Start](agi-eval/docs/en/quick_start.md) to learn how to evaluate these datasets. If you want to customize and adapt more public datasets, see [Public Datasets](agi-eval/docs/en/common_dataset.md).

2. The framework also supports evaluating datasets in any format. See [Custom Datasets](agi-eval/docs/en/custom_dataset.md) to learn how to adapt custom datasets.

3. The framework supports a high degree of customizable development capabilities, namely the [Plugin System](agi-eval/docs/en/component/plugin_system.md). See [Plugin Development Guide](agi-eval/docs/en/component/plugin_guides.md) to learn how to customize plugins.
